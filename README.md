# HackersX - [PLANNED SERVER MAINTENANCE]
* HXCHS.github.io will be undergoing a overhaul update and will be receiving several features including system status page which will display which unblockers are down or up along with support tickets (maybe), I will also add in a IT Team application form so that those who are interested may send a request to work at Hackers-X IT Department it isnt a big company or even a company at all but apply if you want. I may possibly remove the clockwork OS and begin working on HXOS (Hackers-X Operating System) which will hopefully not even show up in your history or open in an about:blank tab. This update will take a long time BUT the current version of hxchs.github.io will remain operational until the update is synced to the server which may result in a temporary loss of access to the site, this process should only last about 1 or 2 days maximum. Thank you all for your support with starring this project, keep it up! ~ Hackers-X

## [ READ ]
* I am aware that nebula is broken at times and wont work, but that is nebula, not clockwork, or my website. The best solution is to be patient and wait for it to be working again. Also, there is another working unblocker in the store called Phantom Games, install it and open it and then scroll to the bottom where it says apps and click google, done. You can also mess around with other apps in the store. Thanks for reading this.
