# HackersX - [PLANNED SERVER MAINTENANCE]
* HXCHS.github.io will be undergoing an overhaul update and will be receiving several features including a system status page that will display which unblockers are down or up along with support tickets (maybe), I will also add an IT Team application form so that those who are interested may send a request to work at Hackers-X IT Department it isn't a company at all but apply if you want. I may remove the clockwork OS and begin working on HXOS (Hackers-X Operating System) which will not appear in your history or open in an about:blank tab. This update will take a long time, but the current version of hxchs.github.io will remain operational until the update is synced to the server which may result in a temporary loss of access to the site. This process should only last about 1 or 2 days maximum. Thank you all for your support in starring this project. Keep it up! ~ Hackers-X

## [ READ ]
* I know Nebula is sometimes broken and won't work, but that is Nebula, not Clockwork or my website. The best solution is to be patient and wait for it to work again. Also, there is another working unblocker in the store called Phantom Games. Install it, open it, scroll to the bottom where it says apps, and click Google, done. You can also mess around with other apps in the store. Thanks for reading this.
